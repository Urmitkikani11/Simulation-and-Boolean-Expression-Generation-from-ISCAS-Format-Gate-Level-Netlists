# Simulation-and-Boolean-Expression-Generation-from-ISCAS-Format-Gate-Level-Netlists
A Python tool for simulating gate-level digital circuits from ISCAS-format netlists. It computes output values for user-defined inputs and recursively generates Boolean expressions for each output. Designed for educational use, circuit analysis, and helping users understand digital logic behavior step by step.
